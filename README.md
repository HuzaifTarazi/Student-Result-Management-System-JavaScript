A beginner-level JavaScript program that collects marks for multiple students, validates input, calculates total marks and percentage, and assigns grades using conditional logic. Results are displayed dynamically on the webpage using DOM manipulation.

This project focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts such as loops, conditions, input validation, type conversion, and basic debugging. It was created purely for learning and logic-building purposes.
